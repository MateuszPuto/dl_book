\section*{What will we look at in this course?}


\noindent The only preliminary is basic understanding of mathematics. Many of the advanced topics will not be covered here, and that was not the goal in mind of an author. Rather than introducing as much of the material as possible, he is of the mind that one is better of understanding deeply basic concepts than having a hazy idea about whole lot of ideas but not being able to reproduce any of them. Author wishes to cover mathematical optimization, neural networks, search trees and reinforcement learning. To the beginner it may seem like not a whole much, but the expert may think that we will cover every subject badly. In the mind of the author all of these objections are valid but subjects were chosen in the pursuit of creating the most complete self contained story while presenting the most powerful existing techniques. In time of writing statistical methods dominated the landscape and symbolic ways were a bit of forgotten beast.
